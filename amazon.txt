1. design problem - design a restaurant menu where the user is able to choose from categories of food (pasta, burger, salad, soup)
under each category, there will be specific food items with a price point.
the user is able to choose specific items and toppings as well (a general list of toppings & price for that topping for all foods);
the user will have a sub-total.
what API endpoints will we need to make a menu request and to save the order?

2. given a sentence, return the first non-unique word in the sentence. "amazon is amazing and is great"

3. 
input:
arr1 = ['a','b','c']
arr2 = ['1','2','3']

output = all combinations of strings such that the order of placement remains the same within its respective arr1 and arr2s.

for example => 'abc123', 'a123bc', 'a1b2c3'.
invalid example => 'a2b1c3' because 2 1 3 is not in order of the original arr
return all combinations in an array
